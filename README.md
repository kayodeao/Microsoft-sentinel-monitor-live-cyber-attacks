# Monitoring Cyber Attacks on Azure VM using Azure Sentinel

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Microsoft's Azure Sentinel SIEM to monitor and analyze cyber attacks on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM). By deploying a vulnerable VM and utilizing a custom PowerShell script, the project captures data on attempted Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logs. This data, along with geolocation information obtained from a third-party API, is logged in Azure Sentinel for analysis and visualization.

- Ping VM via Host's command line to make sure it is reachable `ping -t <VM IP>`

![](images/defender_off.png)

## Step 8: Scripting the Security Log Exporter
- In VM open Powershell ISE
- Set up Edge without signing in
- Copy [Powershell script](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Sentinel-Lab/blob/main/Custom_Security_Log_Exporter.ps1) into VM's Powershell (Written by Josh Madakor)
- Select **New Script** in Powershell ISE and paste script
- Save to Desktop and give it a name (Log_Exporter)

![](images/powershell_script.png)

- Make an account with [Free IP Geolocation API and Accurate IP Lookup Database](https://ipgeolocation.io/)
> This account is free for 1000 API calls per day. Paying 15.00$ will allow 150,000 API calls per month.
- Copy API key once logged in and paste into script line 2: `$API_KEY = "<API key>"`
- Hit **Save**
- Run the PowerShell ISE script (Green play button) in the virtual machine to continuously produce log data

![](images/ipgeolocation.png)

> The script will export data from the Windows Event Viewer to then import into the IP Geolocation service. It will then extract the latitude and longitude and then create a new log called failed_rdp.log in the following location: C:\ProgramData\failed_rdp.log

## Step 9: Create Custom Log in Log Analytics Workspace
- Create a custom log to import the additional data from the IP Geolocation service into Azure Sentinel
- Search "Run" in VM and type "C:\ProgramData"
- Open file named "failed_rdp" hit **CTRL + A** to select all and **CTRL + C** to copy selection
- Open notepad on Host PC and paste contents
- Save to desktop as "failed_rdp.log"
- In Azure go to Log Analytics Workspaces > Log Analytics workspace name > Tables > **Create New custom log (MMA  based)**
![](images/create_customlog.png)
#### Sample
- Select Sample log saved to Desktop (failed_rdp.log) and hit **Next**
#### Record delimiter
- Review sample logs in Record delimiter and hit **Next** 
#### Collection paths
- Type > Windows
- Path > "C:\ProgramData\failed_rdp.log"
#### Details
- Give the custom log a name and provide description (FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO) and hit **Next**
- Hit **Create**

![](images/custom_log.png)

## Step 10: Query the Custom Log
- In Log Analytics Workspaces go to the created workspace (honeypot-log) > Logs
- Run a query to see the available data (FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL)
> May take some time for Azure to sync VM and Log Analytics

![](images/failed_rdp_with_geo.png)

## Step 11: Map Data in Microsoft Sentinel
- Go to Microsoft Sentinel to see the Overview page and available events
- Click on **Workbooks** and **Add workbook** then click **Edit**
- Remove default widgets (Three dots > Remove)
- Click **Add > Add query** 
- Copy/Paste the following query into the query window and **Run Query**
  
```KQL
// Extracting fields from the custom log format FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL
FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL 
| extend username = extract(@"username:([^,]+)", 1, RawData), // Extract username from RawData field
         timestamp = extract(@"timestamp:([^,]+)", 1, RawData), // Extract timestamp from RawData field
         latitude = extract(@"latitude:([^,]+)", 1, RawData), // Extract latitude from RawData field
         longitude = extract(@"longitude:([^,]+)", 1, RawData), // Extract longitude from RawData field
         sourcehost = extract(@"sourcehost:([^,]+)", 1, RawData), // Extract source host from RawData field
         state = extract(@"state:([^,]+)", 1, RawData), // Extract state from RawData field
         label = extract(@"label:([^,]+)", 1, RawData), // Extract label from RawData field
         destination = extract(@"destinationhost:([^,]+)", 1, RawData), // Extract destination host from RawData field
         country = extract(@"country:([^,]+)", 1, RawData) // Extract country from RawData field
| where destination != "samplehost" // Filter out events with destination host "samplehost"
| where sourcehost != "" // Filter out events with empty source host
| summarize event_count=count() by latitude, longitude, sourcehost, label, destination, country // Summarize event count by latitude, longitude, source host, label, destination host, and country
```
- The result should look something like this
  ![](images/failed_rdp.png)

- Once results come up click the **Visualization** dropdown menu and select **Map**
- Select **Map Settings** for additional configuration
#### Layout Settings
- **Location info using** > Latitude/Longitude
- **Latitude** > latitude_CF
- **Longitude** > longitude_CF
- **Size by** > event_count
#### Color Settings
